/**
 * PreToolUse reminder: opening a pull request requires the `pr-creation` skill to
 * have been invoked in this session.
 *
 * Covers both routes an agent actually reaches for: the `gh pr create` CLI and any
 * MCP `create_pull_request` tool, whatever server it is mounted under. Locking one of
 * two equivalent doors just routes the agent through the other, which is what a
 * Bash-only matcher did in a web session where the MCP tool is the default route.
 *
 * A REMINDER, not a containment boundary — which is what bounds its scope. It checks
 * that the Skill tool was called, not that the compress-critique-fix loop ran, and it
 * covers only those two tools. Deliberately out of scope, named so nobody reads this
 * as covering them: `gh api` to `repos/…/pulls` or the `createPullRequest` GraphQL
 * mutation, `curl` to the same endpoint, a script whose body runs `gh pr create`, the
 * web UI. Each is some HTTP client, so matching them means matching arbitrary
 * programs. The deny text claims only the two tools above.
