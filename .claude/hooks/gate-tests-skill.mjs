/**
 * PreToolUse reminder: editing a test file requires the `writing-tests` skill to
 * have been invoked in this session.
 *
 * The gate exists because the rule it enforces — CLAUDE.md's "invoke it whenever
 * you touch tests" — is one an agent misses precisely when it matters. Tests
 * usually arrive as a BYPRODUCT of some other task ("fix this bug"), a few lines
 * at a time in a file already open for another reason, so nothing in the session
 * ever presents itself as "I am writing tests now" and the trigger passes unread.
 *
 * A REMINDER, not a containment boundary. It checks that the Skill tool was
 * called, not that the tests that follow are any good, and it covers the two
 * file-writing tools. Deliberately out of scope, named so nobody reads this as
 * covering them: a heredoc or `sed -i` through Bash, an MCP filesystem writer, an
 * editor outside the session. Matching those means matching arbitrary programs,
 * and this is a nudge at the moment of writing rather than a wall around the
 * files. The deny text claims only what it covers.
