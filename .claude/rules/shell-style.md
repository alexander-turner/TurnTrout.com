# Shell style

Loaded when you touch shell. The cross-language rules (parsers over regex, fail
loud, let exceptions propagate) stay in the root `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Never use `|| true` to silence an expected non-zero exit** — it silently swallows unexpected failures too. Branch on the exit code instead: `cmd; rc=$?; [ "${rc:-0}" -le N ] || exit "$rc"`.
- **Iterating word-split command output under the shared `shellharden` + `shellcheck` hooks**: don't write `for x in $(cmd)` — `shellharden` auto-quotes `$(cmd)`, killing the split, and `shellcheck` then fails with `SC2066`. Don't reach for `mapfile`/`readarray` if the script must run on macOS bash 3.2 (it's bash 4+). Use a portable `while IFS= read -r line; do arr+=("$line"); done < <(cmd)` array, consumed as `"${arr[@]}"`.
- **Any pipe consumer that stops reading early is a latent SIGPIPE bug under `set -o pipefail`** — `grep -q`/`-l`/`-m N`, `head -N`, `head -c N`, `sed '5q'`. The consumer closes the pipe as soon as it has its answer; if the upstream still has output buffered it gets SIGPIPE-killed (exit 141), which `pipefail` reports as failure even though the command succeeded — on exactly the large inputs a cap exists for. Timing-dependent: hides on fast machines, bites on slow CI runners. Fix: consume all output (`awk 'NR <= 20'`) or drop the pipe and cap an already-captured string (`out=$(cmd); [[ "$out" == *pattern* ]]`, `"${out:0:2000}"`, `"${out%%$'\n'*}"`). `check-pipefail-sigpipe.py` enforces this; a producer that provably writes less than the consumer reads opts out with `# sigpipe-ok: <reason>`.
- **`exit` inside `$(…)` only kills the subshell — the parent receives an empty string silently.** A fail-loud helper whose `exit` is swallowed by command substitution cannot abort the caller. Call it as a plain command (`helper; rc=$?`) instead of `var=$(helper)`, so its `exit` propagates. Use `printf -v "$target"` to assign by name from inside the helper when needed.
- **A guard's success means its post-condition holds, not that its command exited 0.** `mkdir -p "$X"` returns 0 on macOS/BSD even when `$X` is a dangling symlink, so trusting exit status lets a later write die cryptically. Verify the state you need (`[[ -d "$X" ]]`) and fail loud.
- **A value-taking CLI flag arm must prove its value exists before reading it.** Under `set -u`, a `case "$1"` arm that does `X="$2"; shift 2` on the strength of only the loop's `while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]` crashes with a raw `$2: unbound variable` when the flag is the final arg — guard each arm with `[[ $# -ge 2 ]] || die "--x needs a value"` (or `${2:?…}`) before the read.
- **Scope signal traps inside the helper, not the caller.** A caller-side `trap ... INT` that stays armed across a function call can fire during that function's return-unwind and corrupt bash 5.2's variable-context stack. Scope the trap inside the helper around just the interruptible command, clear it before returning, and surface the interrupt via return status.
- **Don't hand-repeat a list across sibling commands — make one command carry it.** A Dockerfile `COPY x y z /dest/` followed by `RUN chown … x y z && chmod … x y z` (three enumerations of one list, plus a layer) folds into one `COPY --chown=… --chmod=… x y z /dest/`. Same reflex in shell: prefer `install -o … -g … -m … <files> <dir>` over a `cp` then `chown` then `chmod` that each re-list the files.
- **A comment surfaced as runtime output is not inert.** Some scripts print their leading-comment header as `--help`/usage; error strings reach users and tests. Rewording such a block is a behavior change — check whether the file emits it and run the covering tests first.
