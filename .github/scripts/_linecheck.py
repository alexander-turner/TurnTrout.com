"""
Shared machinery for the line-oriented pre-commit lints under this directory.

Each line-lint script scans a list of paths given on argv, reads each file as
UTF-8 (skipping anything unreadable), runs a per-script detector over the text,
and prints ``<path>:<lineno>: <message>`` to stderr for every hit — returning 1
if any fired. The read loop, the skip-on-OSError/UnicodeDecodeError, the print
loop, and the exit code live here so each script body is just its detector.

Imported as a sibling: the scripts run as ``python3 .github/scripts/check-*.py``,
so this directory is already ``sys.path[0]``; the tests load each script by path,
so each prepends its own dir to ``sys.path`` before importing this module.
