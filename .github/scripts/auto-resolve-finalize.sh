# carries no marker and would otherwise reach the commit — the rail holds
# regardless of what the model did, and it is what bounds a protected-path
# resolution to the file that genuinely conflicted.

# The merge is pushed with TEMPLATE_SYNC_TOKEN — the template's workflow-capable

# RETRIGGERS the PR's checks so the resolved head is re-validated before it can
# auto-merge (a default GITHUB_TOKEN push does not retrigger — GitHub's recursion
# guard — which would strand stale green checks on a tree they never ran against);
# and (2) when the merge commit changes files under .github/workflows/ (the base
# branch moved a workflow underneath the PR, or a workflow itself conflicted),
# GitHub refuses the push from any token lacking the workflow scope — which the
# Actions GITHUB_TOKEN can never hold. TEMPLATE_SYNC_TOKEN carries that scope by
# construction. If it is ABSENT, there is no token that can reliably push this
# merge (a plain GITHUB_TOKEN would fail on any workflow-file change and would not
# retrigger CI even otherwise), so fail closed BEFORE building the merge commit:
# label the PR auto-resolve-blocked (which discover excludes, so every base push
# doesn't re-run a paid resolve into the same wall) and stop until a human
# provisions the secret and removes the label. Checked before the commit so
# fail()'s `git merge --abort` cleanly unwinds the in-progress merge.
