"""Lint: no early-exiting pipe consumer in a script that sets ``pipefail``.

Under ``set -o pipefail`` a pipeline reports the *worst* stage's status, so a
consumer that stops reading before its producer stops writing turns a working
pipeline into a failure: the consumer closes the read end, the producer takes
SIGPIPE, and the pipeline exits 141. With ``set -e`` that aborts the script —
and only on the large inputs the cap exists for, so it hides on a fast machine
and bites on a slow CI runner.

Flagged consumers (each stops reading on its own, mid-stream):

* ``head`` in any form — it exits after its first N lines/bytes.
* ``grep``-family with ``-q`` / ``-l`` / ``-L`` / ``-m N`` (or the long
  spellings) — each exits as soon as the answer is known. Plain ``grep`` reads
  to EOF and is never flagged.
* ``sed`` whose script contains a ``q`` / ``Q`` command.

The fix is to make the consumer read to EOF (``awk 'NR <= 20'``) or to drop the
pipe entirely and cap an already-captured string with a parameter expansion
(``"${out:0:2000}"``, ``"${out%%$'\n'*}"``).

A genuinely-safe site — a producer that provably writes less than the consumer
reads — is exempted with a ``# sigpipe-ok: <reason>`` comment on the pipeline
(or the line just above it); the reason is mandatory so the exemption is
review-visible.

Parser: a real bash AST (``tree-sitter-bash``), so a mention in a comment, a
heredoc, or a quoted string can never be mistaken for a pipeline, and a pipeline
split across continuation lines is still one node. Deliberate false-NEGATIVES,
chosen over risking a spurious red: a consumer reached through a compound
statement / subshell / function rather than named directly in the pipeline; a
command or argument built from an expansion the lint cannot resolve statically;
``awk`` with an ``exit`` (its script needs an awk parser to read honestly); and
a file that inherits ``pipefail`` from a sourced library instead of setting it.
The one conservative direction is the option itself: a file that enables
``pipefail`` anywhere is checked throughout, since knowing the option's value at
a given pipeline needs real dataflow — a pipeline genuinely run with it off
takes the opt-out.

Usage: check-pipefail-sigpipe.py <script.sh> [<script.sh>...]  (exit 1 on hits)
