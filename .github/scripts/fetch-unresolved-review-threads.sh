#
# A "reviewer thread" is a review thread whose ROOT comment was authored by the
# reviewer bot (REVIEWER_LOGIN, default github-actions[bot] — the identity that
# posts the review in post-pr-review.sh). Human threads and the PR author's own
# replies are never touched: we key on the root comment's author only.
#
# Writes $PR_INPUT_DIR/threads.json — a JSON array of
#   {index, id, path, line, body}
# where `index` is a 1-based label (1,2,3…) the Haiku prompt echoes back instead
# of the opaque `id`, so the model never has to reproduce a `PRRT_…` node id
# verbatim (select-resolvable-threads.mjs maps index -> id). Emits
# has_threads=true|false to GITHUB_OUTPUT so the caller can skip the Haiku step
# entirely when there is nothing unresolved.
#
# Env: GH_TOKEN, GH_REPO (owner/name), PR, PR_INPUT_DIR; REVIEWER_LOGIN optional.
