# "did anything match?".

# True iff the range is diffable. Callers that get false MUST fail OPEN (run

# undiffable range would otherwise crash the step or, worse, read as "nothing
# changed" and skip every gated job while the reporter greens the skip.

# PROBLEM CLASS — a merge-queue batch skips a path-gated check that its own
# contents would have run. Under batching GitHub sets merge_group.base_sha to
# the PREVIOUS QUEUE ENTRY, not to the base branch, and the whole batch merges
# on the LAST entry's checks. So a decide script diffing that range sees only
# the final pull request's files, and an earlier entry's break lands on main
# with the gate that covers it reported green.
#
# Echo the base this event must diff FROM. On merge_group that is the point the
# queue branch left the base branch, so the range covers EVERY entry in the
# batch; on every other event the caller's own base stands.
#
# Resolving it needs refs/remotes/origin/<base_ref> in the checkout, so a calling
# job must check out at fetch-depth: 0. When the ref is absent the function warns
# and echoes NOTHING, and each caller takes its own conservative arm: a
# decide_range_usable caller reads the empty base as undiffable and runs
# everything.
