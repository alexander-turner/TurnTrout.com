"""
Print every in-repo file that executes when pytest COLLECTS the given tests.

PROBLEM CLASS — a job's declared trigger paths disagreeing with what the job
actually reads, silently. A decide-gated workflow states its inputs as a
`paths-regex`, which is a hand-written second spelling of a fact the test files
already state in their import lines. When the two disagree, nothing fails: the
decide job says run=false, the work job skips, and report-job-result counts the
skip as a pass, so a required check reports green without running. This module
is the one definition of "what a pytest target depends on", so a caller reads it
instead of retyping it.

Collection-time only. A test's module-level imports run when pytest imports the
module, and so do its class bodies; an import inside a function body does not
run until something calls that function, so it is not a collection-time
dependency and counting it as one produces false triggers. pytest also imports
every conftest.py from each target's directory up to the repo root, so those
join the closure with their own imports followed.

Resolution is repo-relative and first-party only: an import resolves when it
names a file in this tree, and a third-party import simply resolves to nothing.

Stdlib only, and it never IMPORTS the code it reads — the decide job runs on a
bare runner with no virtualenv and no dependencies installed, and parsing is
enough. Run as `python3 .github/scripts/pytest-import-closure.py <test>...`.

Every failure is loud: an unreadable target or a file that will not parse exits
non-zero, because a closure that silently comes back short is the very failure
the caller uses this to prevent.
