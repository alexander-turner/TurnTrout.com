"""
Print every in-repo file the given shell entry points can reach.

PROBLEM CLASS — a job's declared trigger paths disagreeing with what the job
actually runs, silently. A decide-gated workflow states its inputs as a
`paths-regex`, which is a hand-written second spelling of a fact the scripts
already state in their own text. When the two disagree nothing fails: the decide
job says run=false, the work job skips, and report-job-result counts the skip as
a pass, so a required check reports green without running. This module is the one
definition of "what a shell entry point depends on", so a caller derives it
instead of retyping it. Its Python twin is pytest-import-closure.py.

WHY IT READS MENTIONS RATHER THAN PARSING COMMANDS. A lifecycle script EXECUTES
its dependencies (`.hooks/pre-commit`) as often as it `source`s them, and the two
look nothing alike to a parser, so a source-only closure comes back empty on the
very entry point this exists for. Both forms do share one property: the path is
written in the file. So this collects every token that names an existing in-repo
file and recurses into the ones that are shell.

That over-approximates, and the direction is the point. A path the script names
but never runs costs one wasted job run. A path the script runs but never names —
a target assembled from variables — is invisible here, so the caller keeps a
`paths-regex` beside this input and the two are a UNION, never a replacement.
Every doubt in this module therefore adds a path rather than dropping one.

Stdlib only: the decide job runs on a bare runner with no virtualenv. It never
executes, imports or sources what it reads.
