Originally, my content [was hosted on LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/turntrout). Much of that content was meant to be consumed as part of a series - or "sequence" - of blog posts.

## Becoming Stronger

In early 2018, I became convinced that [the AI alignment problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment) needed to be solved. Who, though, would solve it?

I didn't remember much formal math or computer science, but I wanted to give my all anyways. I started reading textbooks. I started reading _a lot_ of textbooks.

## Reframing Impact

## The Causes of Power-Seeking and Instrumental Convergence

This sequence generalizes the math of [Seeking Power is Often Convergently Instrumental in MDPs](./seeking-power-is-often-convergently-instrumental-in-mdps). The posts follow up on [Seeking Power is Often Convergently Instrumental in MDPs](./seeking-power-is-often-convergently-instrumental-in-mdps) and [The Catastrophic Convergence Conjecture](./the-catastrophic-convergence-conjecture).

> [!quote] Original sequence description
> Instrumental convergence posits that smart goal-directed agents will tend to take certain actions (e.g. gain resources, stay alive) in order to achieve their goals. These actions seem to involve taking power _from_ humans. Human disempowerment seems like a key part of how AI might go very, very wrong.

> Many posts in this sequence treat reward functions as "specifying goals", in some sense. This is [wrong](./reward-is-not-the-optimization-target), as I have [argued at length](./against-inner-outer-alignment). Reward signals are akin to a per-datapoint learning rate. Reward chisels circuits into the AI. That's it!

## Shard Theory

In early 2022, [Quintin Pope](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quintin-pope/) and I noticed glaring problems at the heart of "classical" alignment arguments. We thought through the problem with fresh eyes and derived _shard theory_.

Classical arguments focus on what _the_ goal of an AI will be. Why? There's not a good answer that I've ever heard. Shard theory redirects our attention from fixed single objectives. The basic upshot of shard theory: AIs and humans are well-understood[^experimental] as having a bunch of situationally activated goals -- "shards" of desire and preference.

For example, you probably care more about people you can see. Shard theory predicts this outcome. Consider your learned decision-making circuits which bid for actions which care for your friend Bill. These circuits were probably formed when you were able to see Bill (or perhaps the vast majority of your "caring about people" circuits were formed when physically around people). If you can see Bill, that situation is more "similar to the training distribution" for your "caring about Bill" shard. Therefore, the Bill shard is especially likely to fire when you can see him.

[^experimental]: Team Shard's [later experimental work](./understanding-and-controlling-a-maze-solving-policy-network) provided strong evidence that AI policies are not just _well-understood_ as having shards, but in fact mechanistically learn a blend of multiple situationally activated goals.

Thus, [it seems OK if our AIs don't have "perfect" shard mixtures](./alignment-without-total-robustness). The stronger their "aligned shards", the more human welfare weighs on their decision-making. We're playing a game of inches, so let's play to win.
