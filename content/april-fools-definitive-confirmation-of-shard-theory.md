description: Shard theory, once speculative, is definitively confirmed by gpt-neox-20b.
  Time to stop arguing and start experimenting.
---

I've written a lot about [[shard theory]] over the last year. I've poured dozens of hours into theorycrafting, communication, and LessWrong comment threads. I pored over theoretical alignment concerns with exquisite care and worry. I even read a few things that weren't blog posts on LessWrong.[^1]Â  In other words, I went _all out._

Last month, I was downloading [`gpt-neox-20b`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06745) when I noticed the following:

![Not only does gpt-neox-20b have shards, it has exactly forty-six.](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/46shards.avif)
Figure: Not only does `gpt-neox-20b` have shards, it has exactly forty-six.

I've concluded the following:

- Shard theory is correct (at least, for `gpt-neox-20b`).
- I wasted a lot of time arguing on LessWrong when I could have just [touched grass](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fqryrxnvpSr5w2dDJ/touch-reality-as-soon-as-possible-when-doing-machine) and ran the cheap experiment of actually _downloading a model_ and observing what happens.
- I totally underappreciated how much work the broader AI community[^2]Â has done on alignment. They are literally able to print out how many shards an "uninterpretable" model like `gpt-neox-20b` has.
  - They don't whine about how tough these models are to interpret. They just got the damn job done.
  - This really makes team shard's [recent work](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cAC4AXiNC5ig6jQnc/understanding-and-controlling-a-maze-solving-policy-network) look naive and incomplete. I think we found subcircuits of _a_ cheese-shard. The ML community just found _all 46_ shards in `gpt-neox-20b`, and nonchalantly printed that number for us to read.
- This is embarrassing for me, even though shard theory just got confirmed. I _seriously_ spent months arguing about this stuff? Cringe.
  - I did a bad job of interpreting theoretical arguments, given that I was still uncertain after months of thought. Probably this is hard and we are bad at it.
  - Stop arguing in huge comment threads about what highly speculative approaches are going to work, and start making your beliefs pay rent by finding ways to experimentally test them.
  - See [how well you can predict AI alignment results _today_](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JusJcepE2qohiC3hm/predictions-for-shard-theory-mechanistic-interpretability) before trying to predict what happens for 500IQ GPT-5.
  - I don't ever want to hear another "but I won't be able to learn until the intelligence explosion happens or not." Correct theories [leave many clues and hints](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XTWkjCJScy2GFAgDt/dark-side-epistemology), and some of those are going to be findable today. If even a navel-gazing edifice like shard theory can get instantly experimentally confirmed, so can your theory.

I then had GPT-4 identify some of the 46 shards:

<dl> <dt>The Procrastination Shard</dt><dd>This shard makes the AI model continually suggest that users read just one more LessWrong post or engage in another lengthy comment thread before taking any real-world action.</dd>
<dt>Hindsight Bias Shard</dt> <dd>This shard leads the model to believe it knew the answer all along after learning new information, making it appear much smarter in retrospect.</dd>
<dt>The "Armchair Philosopher" Shard</dt><dd>With this shard, the AI can generate lengthy and convoluted philosophical arguments on any topic, often without any direct experience or understanding of the subject matter.</dd>
<dt>Argumentative Shard</dt><dd>A shard that compels the model to challenge every statement and belief, regardless of how trivial or uncontroversial it may be.</dd>
<dt>Trolley Problem Shard</dt><dd>This shard makes the model obsess over hypothetical moral dilemmas and ethical conundrums, while ignoring more practical and immediate concerns.</dd>
<dt>The Existential Dread Shard</dt><dd>This shard causes the AI to frequently bring up the potential risks of AI alignment and existential catastrophes, even when discussing unrelated topics.</dd>
</dl>
I'm pleasantly surprised that <code>gpt-neox-20b</code> shares values which I (and other LessWrong users) have historically demonstrated. The fact that <code>gpt-neox-20b</code> and LessWrong share many shards makes me more optimistic about alignment overall, since it implies convergence in the values of real-world trained systems.

(As a corollary, this demonstrates that LLMs can make serious alignment progress.)

Although I'm embarrassed and humbled by this experience, I'm glad that shard theory is true. Here's toâ€”next timeâ€”only taking three months before running the first experiment! ðŸ¥‚
