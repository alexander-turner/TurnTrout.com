Many people know me as "TurnTrout", but you can call me "Alex". I want to let you see a different facet of me than I usually present online.

I was born in '94. Now, I'm a research scientist on [Google DeepMind's](https://deepmind.google/) scalable alignment team in San Francisco. In this document, I'll overview what the intervening time has made of me, as a person.

I'm straight and [ethically non-monogamous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_non-monogamy).[^partner] I'm hoping to meet a wonderful woman to be [my best friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wife) through thick and thin. üíï

(And by "best friend", I mean "wife.")
[^partner]: As of summer 2024, I have one partner. She's extremely wonderful, and we've been dating for four years.

# About me

I'm kind, conscientious, and very ready to admit mistakes - maybe I'm _too_ ready, to be honest! Speaking of "honest", I'm also an extremely honest person. I haven't always lived as ethically or as honestly as I would now have preferred, and I'm surely going to make more mistakes, but _god damn_ if I'm not going to live this one life well.

If I make a commitment to you, I keep it, and I'm not particularly afraid of commitments. I'm someone you can rely on.[^perfect] One of my friends described me as "not the kind of person who will put up with \[unethical\] conspiracies."

On the other hand, I do love a good _ethical_ conspiracy. I once hatched an elaborate "welcome back" party for a partner who was coming back from overseas. I rounded up 18 of her friends and hid them in my apartment so they could all jump out at her.

[^perfect]: I mean, I'm not _perfectly_ reliable. I'm just a hum - I mean, I'm just a trout! For example, there recently was a situation where I may have simply forgotten what someone had requested two years prior. But I think I am overall highly reliable - both in terms of faithfulness and in terms of logistics.

## Professional life

I'm very hard-working. In 2017, in the second year of [my computer science PhD](/alignment-phd), I found out about the [AI alignment problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment). However, I lacked the skills to contribute to this hilariously neglected super-problem. That lack didn't really matter to me - I thought that the world needed something from me, and I wasn't going to _not even try_.

I might not be good at something at first, but I don't quit! In the second year of my PhD I wasn't comfortable proving mathematical theorems. By the end of my fourth year, I had proved hundreds of new theorems. Some of these results were published in [two](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01683) [papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13477) in a top AI conference.

## Personal life

That said, I've become a bit less research-focused recently. Somewhat relatedly, I'd become somewhat more anxious than I'd like. At the end of 2023, I realized that I just... wasn't enjoying my life? Since then, I've focused on meditation, intentionality, gratitude, and actually taking breaks. 

When I was younger, I wasn't very social. These days, I love meeting new people! I'm an _ambivert_: sometimes socializing is energizing, but sometimes it's draining. I have a lot of friends who are very precious to me, and I wish I could give each of them the time they each deserve. Sometimes I even look out over a city and wonder at the residents:

	<figcaption>Part of me wishes I could meet and deeply understand each and every person here. Each pinpoint of light is shining for a <em>reason</em>, it was put there <em>by another person</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>

So, I care a lot about people - both in the abstract and personally. I've never yelled at anyone in my life (except, you know, I probably did as a young kid, but I don't remember that well).  I'm also a vegan who cares about animals. ü™øüêü

I am pretty goofy if I trust and feel comfy around someone. I think I'd jive well with someone more spontaneous and daring, since I tend to be more planned and conservative. Well, I'm _usually_ more conservative:

# What I like doing

I like doing a lot of things!

Dancing
: I like salsa and waltz. I'm learning West Coast Swing. I can vibe with almost anything, though!

AI-fueled house parties
: I like bringing a ton of my friends together in my 2BR apartment. To commemorate such an occasion, I personalize a name tag for each of them! The tag has their name and then a picture of them. Only, the picture is tailored to the theme of the party:

Design & art
: I designed [this website](/), for example!
: While I don't draw anymore, I've really gone through phases here! For example, in order to communicate research insights which were very dear to me, I wrote and illustrated a series of blog posts called [Reframing Impact](/reframing-impact):
: ![The title card for the series. A cute robot plays around with blocks.](https://assets.turntrout.com/Attachments/reframingImpact.avif)
: ![A recreation of the iconic](https://assets.turntrout.com/Attachments/balrog.avif)
: ![I hand-illustrated Bag End from the Shire, with the help of a reference.](https://assets.turntrout.com/Attachments/hobbitImpactHouse.avif)

Writing
:

Meditation
: I used to say "no, isn't this just learning how to wirehead and evoke fake happiness for no reason?". Then I got really, really sad, so I said "screw it." I made the right choice, though I'm still not particularly skilled.

Reading textbooks
: [Yes](./set-theory-textbook-review) [this](./linear-algebra-textbook-review) [is](./first-analysis-textbook-review) [a](./all-of-statistics-textbook-review) [real](./second-analysis-textbook-review) [thing](./functional-analysis-textbook-review) [I](./insights-from-modern-principles-of-economics) [do](./computability-and-logic-textbook-review) [for](./ordinary-differential-equations-textbook-review) [fun](./RL-textbook-review) [sometimes.](./topology-textbook-review)


# How compatible are we?

## Possible dealbreakers

1. I probably (70%) will want kids within the next 5 years.
2. Ethical non-monogamy is important to me.

## What I appreciate in a partner

This isn't a list of _demands_ or anything, just ingredients for a good relationship with me:

- Trustworthiness, high empathy, and emotional maturity
- Intellect/wits/sharpness
- We can talk for hours about nothing
- Confidence is hot
- Being good at STEM is also hot
- Non-avoidant attachment style
- The kind of girl [^ethical]who would have refused to obey in [the Milgram experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment) ü•∞
- Spontaneous and medium-adventurous, but not to the point where you're trying to backflip out of a plane while naked even though it's 10:30PM and we have an early morning the next day...
- Some dispositional _je ne sais quoi_ which makes me feel at ease.
  [^ethical]: AKA, ethical in the "I'll actually stand up in real life" way and not just ethical in the "I'll talk for hours about the nature of goodness" way.

If this sounds like a nice potential connection, I'd love to:
1. Take you dancing üíÉ, or
2. Spend a lazy Sunday morning watching the stream run by the [Hidden Cafe](https://www.thehiddencafe.life/), or
3. Have a sunset picnic and eat blueberries.
