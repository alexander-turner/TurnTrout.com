Sometimes, it's easier to say how things change than to say how things are.

When you write down a differential equation, you're specifying constraints and information about e.g. how to model something in the world. This gives you a family of solutions, from which you can pick out any function you like, depending on details of the problem at hand.

Today, I finished the bulk of Logan's [_A First Course in Ordinary Differential Equations_](https://www.amazon.com/First-Course-Ordinary-Differential-Equations/dp/8132235274), which is easily the best ODE book I came across.

# A First Course in Ordinary Differential Equations

As usual, I'll just talk about random cool things from the book.

## Bee Movie

In the summer of 2018 at a MIRI-CHAI intern workshop, I witnessed a fascinating debate: What mathematical function represents the _movie time_ elapsed in videos like [The Entire Bee Movie but every time it says bee it speeds up by 15%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMG1Nl7uWko)? That is, what mapping $t \mapsto x(t)$ converts the viewer timestamp to the movie timestamp for this video?

I don't remember their conclusion, but it's simple enough to answer. Suppose $f(t)$ counts how many times a character has said the word "bee" by timestamp $t$ in the movie. Since the viewing speed itself increases exponentially with $f$, we have $x'(t) = 1.15^{f(x(t))}$. Furthermore, since the video starts at the beginning of the movie, we have the initial condition $x(0)=0$.

This problem cannot be cleanly solved analytically (because $f$ is discontinuous and obviously lacking a clean closed form), but _is_ expressed by a beautiful and simple differential equation.

## Gears-level models?

Differential equations help us explain and model phenomena, often giving us insight into causal factors. For a trivial example, a population might grow more quickly _because_ that population is larger.

## Equilibria and stability theory

This material gave me a great conceptual framework for thinking about stability. Here are some good handles:

![](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/eb2E5Eg.avif)

Let's think about rocks and hills. _Unstable_ equilibria have the rock rolling away forever lost, no matter how lightly the rock is nudged, while _locally stable_ equilibria have some level of tolerance within which they'll settle back down. For a _globally stable_ equilibrium, no matter how hard the perturbation, the rock comes rolling back down the parabola.

## Resonance

> [!quote] Wikipedia
> A familiar example is a playground swing, which acts as a pendulum. Pushing a person in a swing in time with the natural interval of the swing (its resonant frequency) makes the swing go higher and higher (maximum amplitude), while attempts to push the swing at a faster or slower tempo produce smaller arcs. This is because the energy the swing absorbs is maximized when the pushes match the swing's natural oscillations.

[And that's also how the Tacoma bridge collapsed in 1940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mclp9QmCGs). The second-order differential equations underlying this allow us to solve for the forcing function which could induce catastrophic resonance.

Also note that there is only at most _one_ resonant frequency of any given system, because even lower octaves of the natural frequency would provide destructive interference a good amount of the time.

### Random notes

- This book gave me great chance to review my calculus, from integration by parts to the deeper meaning of Taylor's theorem: that for many functions, you can recover all of the global information from the local information, in the form of derivatives. I don't fully understand why this doesn't work for some functions which are infinitely differentiable (like $\log x$), but apparently this becomes clearer after some complex analysis.
- Bifurcation diagrams allow us to model the behavior, birth, and destruction of equilibria as we vary parameters in the differential equation. I'm looking forward to learning more about bifurcation theory. [In this video, Veratasium highlights stunning patterns behind the bifurcation diagrams of single-humped functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk).

# Forwards

I supplemented my understanding with the first two chapters of Strogatz's [_Nonlinear Dynamics And Chaos_](https://www.amazon.com/Nonlinear-Dynamics-Chaos-Applications-Nonlinearity/dp/0738204536). I might come back for more of the latter at a later date; I'm feeling like moving on and I think it's important to follow that feeling.
