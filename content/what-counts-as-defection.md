People talk about "defection" in [social dilemma](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/002075900399402) games, from the [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma) to [stag hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_hunt) to [chicken](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(game)>). In the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons), we talk about defection. The concept has become a regular part of LessWrong discourse.

> [!note] Informal definition: Defection
> A player _defects_ when they increase their personal payoff at the expense of the group.

This informal definition is no secret, being echoed from the ancient [_Formal Models of Dilemmas in Social Decision-Making_](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA006188.pdf) to the recent [_Classifying games like the Prisoner's Dilemma_](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KwbJFexa4MEdhJbs4/classifying-games-like-the-prisoner-s-dilemma):

> [!quote]
> you can model the "defect" action as "take some value for yourself, but destroy value in the process".

Given that the prisoner's dilemma is the bread and butter of game theory and of many parts of economics, evolutionary biology, and psychology, you might think that someone had already formalized this. However, to my knowledge, no one has.

# Formalism

Consider a finite $n$ \-player normal-form game, with player $i$ having pure action set $\mathcal{A}_i$ and payoff function $P_i: \mathcal{A}_1\times\ldots\times \mathcal{A}_n \to \mathbb{R}$. Each player $i$ chooses a _strategy_ $s_i\in\Delta(\mathcal{A}_i)$ (a distribution over $\mathcal{A}_i$). Together, the strategies form a _strategy profile_ $\mathbf{s}:= (s_1,\ldots, s_n)$. $\mathbf{s}_{-i}:=(s_1,\ldots,s_{i-1},s_{i+1},\ldots,s_n)$ is the strategy profile, excluding player $i$'s strategy. A _payoff profile_ contains the payoffs for all players under a given strategy profile.

A _utility weighting_ $(\alpha_j)_{j=1,\ldots,n}$ is a set of $n$ non-negative weights (as in [Harsanyi's utilitarian theorem](https://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/371/1991_EUI%20WP_ECO_032.pdf?sequence=1)). You can consider the weights as quantifying each player's contribution; they might represent a perceived social agreement or be the explicit result of a bargaining process.

When all $\alpha_j$ are equal, we'll call that an _equal weighting_. However, if there are "utility monsters", we can downweight them accordingly.

We're implicitly assuming that payoffs are comparable across players. We want to investigate: _given_ a utility weighting, which actions are defections?

> [!math] Definition: Defection
> Player $i$'s action $a\in \mathcal{A}_i$ is a _defection_ against strategy profile $\mathbf{s}$ and weighting $(\alpha_j)_{j=1,\ldots,n}$ if
>
> 1.  $\text{Personal gain: }P_i(a, \mathbf{s}_{-i})>P_i(s_i,\mathbf{s}_{-i})$
> 2.  Social loss: $\sum_{j} \alpha_jP_j(a, \mathbf{s}_{-i})<\sum_{j} \alpha_jP_j(s_i,\mathbf{s}_{-i})$
>
> If such an action exists for some player $i$, strategy profile $\mathbf{s}$, and weighting, then we say that _there is an opportunity for defection_ in the game.
>
> ---
>
> For an equal weighting, condition (2) is equivalent to demanding that the action not be a [Kaldor-Hicks improvement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaldor%E2%80%93Hicks_efficiency).

<br/>Figure: Payoff profiles in the Prisoner's Dilemma. Red arrows represent defections against pure strategy profiles; player 1 defects vertically, while player 2 defects horizontally. For example, player 2 defects with $(C_1,C_2)\to(C_1,D_2)$ because they gain ($4>3$) but the weighted sum loses out ($4<6$).

This definition seems to make reasonable intuitive sense. In the tragedy of the commons, each player rationally increases their utility, while imposing negative externalities on the other players and decreasing total utility. A spy might leak classified information, benefiting themselves and Russia but defecting against America.

> [!math] Definition: Cooperation
> _Cooperation_ takes place when a strategy profile is maintained despite the opportunity for defection.

I will now state some obvious results without proof.

> [!math] Theorem 1: In constant-sum games, there is no opportunity for defection against equal weightings

> [!math] Theorem 2: No defection in common-payoff scenarios
> In common-payoff games (where all players share the same payoff function), there is no opportunity for defection.

In private communication, Joel Leibo points out that Theorems 1 and 2 formalize the intuition behind the proverb "all's fair in love and war." That is, you can't defect in fully competitive or fully cooperative situations.

> [!math] Theorem 3: There is no opportunity for defection against Nash equilibria

> [!math] Definition: Pareto improvement
> An action $a\in\mathcal{A}_i$ is a _Pareto improvement_ over strategy profile $\mathbf{s}$ if, for all players $j$, $P_j(a,\mathbf{s}_{-i})\geq P_j(s_i,\mathbf{s}_{-i})$.

> [!math] Proposition 4: Pareto improvements are never defections

# Game Theorems

We can prove that formal defection exists in the trifecta of famous games. Expand the callouts to view the proofs if you're interested.

## Prisoner's dilemma

<br/>Figure: In (a), variables stand for $T$emptation, $R$eward, $P$unishment, and $S$ucker. A 2x2 symmetric game is a _Prisoner's Dilemma_ when $T>R>P>S$. Unsurprisingly, formal defection is everywhere in this game.

> [!math]- Theorem 5: In 2x2 symmetric games, if the Prisoner's Dilemma inequality is satisfied, defection can exist against equal weightings.
>
> _Proof._ Suppose the Prisoner's Dilemma inequality holds. Further suppose that $R>\frac{1}{2} (T+S)$. Then $2R>T+S$. Then since $T>R$ but $T+S<2R$, both players defect from $(C_1,C_2)$ with $D_i$.
>
> Suppose instead that $R\leq \frac{1}{2}(T+S)$. Then $T+S\geq 2R>2P$, so $T+S>2P$. But $P>S$, so player 1 defects from $(C_1,D_2)$ with action $D_1$, and player 2 defects from $(D_1, C_2)$ with action $D_2$. ∎

## Stag hunt

![](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/0de841661949492409f34e304c124aa51fdf5af64f9514fc.avif)
<br/>Figure: A 2x2 symmetric game is a _Stag Hunt_ when $R>T\geq P>S$. In Stag Hunts, due to uncertainty about whether the other player will hunt stag, players defect and fail to coordinate on the unique Pareto optimum $(\text{Stag}_1,\text{ Stag}_2)$. In (b), player 2 will defect (play $\text{Hare}_2$) when $\mathbb{P}(\text{Stag}_1)<\frac{1}{2}$. In Stag Hunts, formal defection can always occur against mixed strategy profiles, which lines up with defection in this game being due to uncertainty.

> [!math]- Theorem 6: In 2x2 symmetric games, if the Stag Hunt inequality is satisfied, defection can exist against equal weightings.
>
> _Proof._ Suppose that the Stag Hunt inequality is satisfied. Let $p$ be the probability that player 1 plays $\text{Stag}_1$. We now show that player 2 can always defect against strategy profile $(p, \text{Stag}_2)$ for some value of $p$.
>
> For defection's first condition, we determine when $P_2(p,\text{Stag}_2)<P_2(p,\text{Hare}_2)$:

> $$
>
> This denominator is positive ($R>T$ and $P>S$), as is the numerator. The fraction clearly falls in the open interval $(0,1)$.
>

>
> $$
> \begin{align*}   P_1(p,\text{Stag}_2) + P_2(p,\text{Stag}_2)&>P_1(p,\text{Hare}_2)+P_2(p,\text{Hare}_2)\\   2pR + (1-p)(T+S) &> p(S+T) + (1-p) 2P\\   p&> \dfrac{1}{2}  \dfrac{(P-S)+(P-T)}{(R-T)+(P-S)}.\end{align*}

> \begin{align*}   1>\dfrac{P-S}{(R-T)+(P-S)}>p>\dfrac{1}{2} \dfrac{(P-S)+(P-T)}{(R-T)+(P-S)}.\end{align*}
> $$
>
> Since $P-T\leq0$, this holds for some nonempty subinterval of $[0,1)$. ∎

## Chicken

![](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/9a5af9e1b5fd6a2b840a77e1cdcd7d3be6941064a178be8b.avif)
<br/>Figure: A 2x2 symmetric game is _Chicken_ when $T>R\geq S>P$. In (b), defection only occurs when $\frac{10}{11}<\mathbb{P}(\text{Turn}_1)<\frac{21}{22}$: when player 1 is very likely to turn, player 2 is willing to trade a bit of total payoff for personal payoff.

> [!math]- Theorem 7: In 2x2 symmetric games, if the Chicken inequality is satisfied, defection can exist against equal weightings.
>
> _Proof._ Assume that the Chicken inequality is satisfied. This proof proceeds similarly as in theorem 6. Let $p$ be the probability that player 1's strategy places on $\text{Turn}_1$.
>

> $$
>
> The inequality flips in the first equation because of the division by $(R-T)+(P-S)$, which is negative ($T>R$ and $S>P$). $S>P$, so $p>0$; this reflects the fact that $(\text{Ahead}_1, \text{Turn}_2)$ is a Nash equilibrium, against which defection is impossible (proposition 3).

> $$
>
> The inequality again flips because $(R-T)+(P-S)$ is negative. When $R\leq    \frac{1}{2}(T+S)$, we have $p<1$, in which case defection does not exist against a pure strategy profile.

# Discussion

This bit of basic theory will hopefully allow for things like principled classification of policies: "has an agent learned a "non-cooperative" policy in a multi-agent setting?". For example, the empirical game-theoretic analyses of Leibo et al.'s [_Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning in Sequential Social Dilemmas_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.03037.pdf) say that apple-harvesting agents are defecting when they zap each other with beams. Instead of using a qualitative metric, you could choose a desired non-zapping strategy profile, and then use Leibo's analysis tool to classify formal defections from that. This approach would still have a free parameter, but it seems better.

---

I had vague pre-theoretic intuitions about "defection", and now I feel more capable of reasoning about what is and isn't a defection. In particular, I'd been confused by the difference between [power-seeking](/seeking-power-is-often-convergently-instrumental-in-mdps) and defection, and now I'm not.
