## AU landscape as a unifying frame

Attainable utilities are calculated by winding your way through possibility-space, considering and discarding possibility after possibility to find the best plan you can. This frame is unifying.

Sometimes you advantage one AU at the cost of another, moving through the state space towards the best possibilities for one goal and away from the best possibilities for another goal. This tradeoff is _opportunity cost_.

![Hand-drawn diagram illustrating opportunity cost with three trade-offs. "TV vs books" shows a person watching TV with a book dangling unread from their hand. "Hiking vs minimizing distance to nearest airport" shows a hiker 5 miles from an airport. "Reading this post vs sleeping" shows this article on a computer vs a person asleep at 3:10.](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/z4o5j3F.avif)

Sometimes you gain more control over the future: most of the best possibilities make use of a windfall of cash. Sometimes you act to preserve control over the future: most Tic-Tac-Toe goals involve not ending the game right away. Otherwise put: preserving _power_.

![A game tree for Tic-Tac-Toe showing how choices affect future possibilities. A central board state branches into many possible future game states. Some branches lead to terminal states while others continue to branch, illustrating the preservation of options.](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/3HUBl5H.avif)

Other people usually _objectively impact_ you by decreasing or increasing a bunch of your AUs (generally, by changing your power). This happens for an extremely wide range of goals because of the structure of the environment.

Sometimes, the best possibilities are made unavailable or worsened only for goals much like yours. This outcome involves a _value impact_ for your goals.

![Text: "Value impact" is "important to agents like you." "Objective impact" is "important to agents in general," illustrated by an asteroid hitting Earth and two agents using money for different goals: "I can buy John a gift!" and "I can buy pebbles!"](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/Sj2LrqK.avif)

Sometimes a bunch of the best possibilities go through the same part of the future: fast travel to random places on Earth usually involves the airport. This commonality is _instrumental convergence_.

![An illustration of instrumental convergence on a globe. Multiple flight paths to different destinations all originate from a single airport. A nearby arrow notes "you start here [a small distance from the airport]."](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/T8JS7kT.avif)

## Appendix: AU landscape and world state contain equal information

In the context of finite deterministic Markov decision processes, there's a wonderful handful of theorems which basically say that the AU landscape and the environmental dynamics encode each other. That is, they contain the _same_ information, just with different emphasis. This supports thinking of the AU landscape as a "dual" of the world state.

As our interest concerns optimal value functions, we consider only stationary, deterministic policies: $\Pi := \mathcal{A}^\mathcal{S}$.

> To this end, for $\pi \in \Pi$, consider the mapping of $\pi \mapsto (\mathbf{I}-\gamma \mathbf{T}^\pi)^{-1}$ (where $\mathbf{T}^\pi(s,s') :=T(s,\pi(s),s')$); in other words, each policy $\pi$ maps to a function mapping each state $s_0$ to a discounted state visitation frequency vector $\mathbf{f}^\pi_{s_0}$, which we call a _possibility_. The meaning of each frequency vector is: starting in state $s_0$ and following policy $\pi$, what sequence of states $s_0, s_1, \ldots$ do we visit in the future? States visited later in the sequence are discounted according to $\gamma$: the sequence $s_0s_1s_2s_2\ldots$ would induce 1 visitation frequency on $s_0$, $\gamma$ visitation frequency on $s_1$, and $\frac{\gamma^2}{1-\gamma}$ visitation frequency on $s_2$.

![A maze represents the space of possibilities, with a pink dashed line showing one specific path being taken. Above, text reads: "Each [state visit distribution] f is a possible path through time."](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/beLDjAs.avif)

The possibility function $\mathcal{F}(s)$ outputs the possibilities available at a given state $s$:

![Figure 1: "A simple example." A state diagram shows blue node 1 with arrows to red node 2 and black node 3. Nodes 2 and 3 have self-loops. Below, equations for the possibility function F at each state are: F(1) = \{ [1 (blue), γ/(1-γ) (red), 0 (black)], [1, 0, γ/(1-γ)] \}, F(2) = \{ [0, 1/(1-γ), 0] \}, F(3) = \{ [0, 0, 1/(1-γ)] \}.](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/H1HS9Zk.avif)

Put differently, the possibilities available are all of the potential film-strips of how-the-future-goes you can induce from the current state.

### Possibility isomorphism

We say two rewardless MDPs $M$ and $M'$ are _isomorphic up to possibilities_ if they induce the same possibilities. Possibility isomorphism captures the essential aspects of an MDP's structure, while being invariant to state representation, state labelling, action labelling, and the addition of superfluous actions (actions whose results are duplicated by other actions available at that state). Formally, $M \simeq_\mathcal{F} M'$ when there exists a bijection $\phi : \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{S}'$ (letting $\mathbf{P}_\phi$ be the corresponding $|\mathcal{S}|$\-by-$| \mathcal{S}' |$ permutation matrix) satisfying $\mathcal{F}_M(s)=\left\{\mathbf{P}_\phi\mathbf{f}'\,|\,\mathbf{f}'\in\mathcal{F}_{M'}(\phi(s))\right\}$ for all $s\in\mathcal{S}$.

This isomorphism is a natural contender[^1] for the canonical (finite) MDP isomorphism:

> [!math] A theorem I proved
> $M$ and $M'$ are isomorphic up to possibilities IFF their directed graphs are isomorphic (and they have the same discount rate).

### Representation equivalence

Suppose I give you the following possibility sets, each containing the possibilities for a different state:

$$
\begin{align*}
\left\{\begin{pmatrix}
           4 \\
           0 \\
           0 \end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
           1 \\
           .75 \\
           2.25 \end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
           \frac{1}{.4375}\\ 4-\frac{1}{.4375} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\right\}
\qquad \\
\\
\left\{\begin{pmatrix}
           0 \\
           0 \\
           4 \end{pmatrix}
\right\} \qquad\left\{\begin{pmatrix}
           0 \\
           1 \\
           3 \end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
           4-\frac{1}{.4375}\\ \frac{1}{.4375} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
           3 \\
           1 \\
           0 \end{pmatrix}
\right\}
\end{align*}
$$

In MDPs, the "AU landscape" is the set of optimal value functions for all reward functions over states in that MDP. If you know the optimal value functions for just $|\mathcal{S}|$ reward functions, you can also reconstruct the rewardless MDP structure.[^3]

From the environment (rewardless MDP), you can deduce the AU landscape (all optimal value functions) and all possibilities. From possibilities, you can deduce the environment and the AU landscape. From the AU landscape, you can deduce the environment (and thereby all possibilities).

![A diagram showing that "Rewardless MDP," "Optimal value functions," and "Possibilities" are equivalent concepts. The three terms are arranged in a triangle, connected by double-headed arrows in a cycle to show they can all be derived from one another and encode the same information.](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/D8PPNKp.avif)
Figure: All of these encode the same mathematical object.

## Appendix: Opportunity cost

Opportunity cost is when an action you take makes you more able to achieve one goal but less able to achieve another. Even this simple world has opportunity cost:

![A state diagram illustrating opportunity cost. A central black state connects to a purple state on the left and a green state on the right. To move between the purple and green states, one must pass through the black state. The purple and green states also have self-loops.](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/rFfZvVh.avif)

Going to the green state means you can't get to the purple state as quickly.

On a deep level, why is the world structured such that this happens? Could you imagine a world without opportunity cost of any kind? The answer, again in the rewardless MDP setting, is simple: "yes, but the world would be trivial: you wouldn't have any choices". Using a straightforward formalization of opportunity cost, we have:

> [!math] Existence of opportunity cost
> Opportunity cost exists in an environment IFF there is a state with more than one possibility.

Philosophically, opportunity cost exists when you have meaningful choices. When you make a choice, you're necessarily moving away from some potential future but towards another; since you can't be in more than one place at the same time, opportunity cost follows. Equivalently, we assumed the agent isn't infinitely farsighted ($\gamma<1$); if it were, it would be possible to be in "more than one place at the same time", in a sense (thanks to Rohin Shah for this interpretation).

While understanding opportunity cost may seem like a side-quest, each insight is another brick in the edifice of our understanding of the incentives of goal-directed agency.

# Notes

- Just as game theory is a great abstraction for modeling competitive and cooperative dynamics, AU landscape is great for thinking about consequences: it automatically excludes irrelevant details about the world state. We can think about the effects of events without needing a specific utility function or ontology to evaluate them. In multi-agent systems, we can straightforwardly predict the impact the agents have on each other and the world.
- “Objective impact to a location” means that agents whose plans route through the location tend to be objectively impacted.
- The landscape is not the territory: [AU is calculated with respect to an agent's _beliefs_](/the-gears-of-impact), not necessarily with respect to what really "could" or will happen.

[^1]: The possibility isomorphism is new to my work, as are all other results shared in this post. This apparent lack of basic theory regarding MDPs is strange; even stranger, this absence was actually pointed out in two [published](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3179-stable-dual-dynamic-programming.pdf) [papers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4220813)!

    I find the existing MDP isomorphisms/equivalences to be pretty lacking. The details don't fit in this margin, but perhaps in a paper at some point. If you want to coauthor this (mainly compiling results, finding a venue, and responding to reviews), let me know. Added later: The results are available in the appendices of [my dissertation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11831).

[^2]: In fact, you can reconstruct the environment using only a limited subset of possibilities: the _non-dominated_ possibilities.

[^3]: As a tensor, the transition function $T$ has size $|\mathcal{A}|\cdot|\mathcal{S}|^2$, while the AU landscape representation only has size $|\mathcal{S}|^2$. However, if you're just representing $T$ as a transition _function_, it has size $|\mathcal{A}|\cdot|\mathcal{S}|$.
