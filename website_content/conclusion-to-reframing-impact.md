# Appendix: Probability estimates

I've made many claims in these posts. All views are my own.

| Statement | Credence |
|:---------:|:---------|
| There exists a simple closed-form solution to catastrophe avoidance (in the outer alignment sense). | 25% |
| For the superhuman case, penalizing the agent for increasing its own Attainable Utility (AU) is better than penalizing the agent for increasing other AUs. | 65% |
| Some version of Attainable Utility Preservation solves side effect problems for an extremely wide class of real-world tasks and for subhuman agents. | 65% |
| The catastrophic convergence conjecture is true. That is, unaligned goals tend to have catastrophe-inducing optimal policies because of power-seeking incentives. | 70%[^ccc] |
| Agents trained by powerful RL algorithms on arbitrary reward signals generally try to take over the world. | 75%[^power] |
| AUP<sub>conceptual</sub> prevents catastrophe, assuming the catastrophic convergence conjecture. | 85% |
| Attainable Utility theory describes how people feel impacted. | 95% |

[^power]: [The theorems on power-seeking](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01683) only apply to optimal policies in fully observable environments, which isn't realistic for real-world agents. However, I think they're still informative. There are also strong intuitive arguments for power-seeking.

[^ccc]: There seems to be a dichotomy between "catastrophe directly incentivized by goal" and "catastrophe indirectly incentivized by goal through power-seeking", although `Vika` [provides intuitions in the other direction](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sHpiiZS2gPgoPnijX/conclusion-to-reframing-impact?commentId=6sxBzsh8yfwnPk4iH#6sxBzsh8yfwnPk4iH).

# Appendix: Easter Eggs

The big art pieces (and especially the last illustration in this post) were designed to convey a specific meaning, the interpretation of which I leave to the reader.

The sequence hides a few pop culture references which I think are obvious enough to not need pointing out, and a lot of hidden smaller playfulness which doesn't quite rise to the level of "easter egg".

Reframing Impact
: The bird's nest contains a literal easter egg.
:
: ![Handwritten text reads: "The world is wide, and full of objects." Below, a white space contains simple drawings of a bird's nest, a blue bird, a pink circle, a grey circle labeled "worst," and a pink smiley face.](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/hdlkd44jvawsxgpthbgi.avif)
:
: The paperclip-Balrog drawing contains a [Tengwar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengwar) inscription which reads "one measure to bind them", with "measure" in impact-blue and "them" in utility-pink.
:
: ![Text overlay: "An impact measure would be the first proposed safeguard which maybe actually stops a powerful agent with an imperfect objective from ruining things â€“ without assuming anything about the objective. This is a rare property among approaches." The text lurks above an illustration paying homage to the iconic Gandalf-vs-Balrog scene in Moria. The demon's whip ends in a giant paperclip, a metaphor for a misaligned artificial intelligence.](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/v7pzpzvi342b3svksbag.avif)

: "Towards a New Impact Measure" was the title of [the post](/towards-a-new-impact-measure) in which AUP was introduced:
:
: ![The interior of a cozy, hobbit-hole-like room with a round door open to a sunny landscape. Sunlight streams in, illuminating the tiled floor. Text over the view reads "Towards a new impact measure" and is rendered in a Tolkienesque font.](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/ynwdidys1i7yopyqerfh.avif)

Attainable Utility Theory: Why Things Matter
:
: This style of maze is from the video game _Undertale_.
:
: ![A colorful grid maze in the style of the video game "Undertale." On the left, a white square with a plus sign is labeled "you." In the top right corner, a dark grey square is labeled "Your goal."](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/olz9peoa2krvvorlgdn8.avif)

<br/>

Seeking Power is Often Convergently Instrumental in MDPs
:
: To seek power, Frank is trying to get at the Infinity Gauntlet.
:
: ![A crying cartoon robot jumps from stacked crates, straining to reach a high ledge where a treasure chest contains the glowing Infinity Gauntlet.](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/pdqrmsxtawdzt2c7idez.avif)

<br/>

The tale of Frank and the orange Pebblehoarder
: Speaking of under-tales, a friendship has been blossoming right under our noses:
:
: ![A cartoon of Frank the robot giving his pink marble to a surprised Pebblehoarder. They stand in a grassy field under a sunny sky.](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/dfog9czq2wdboz8m0dpv.avif)
Figure: After the Pebblehoarders suffer the devastating transformation of all of their pebbles into obsidian blocks, Frank generously gives away his favorite pink marble as a makeshift pebble.
:
:
: !["Impact" is written in large blue letters inside a sparkling frame. Below, text reads: "Written and illustrated by Alex Turner." To the right, a small robot stands on a larger robot to build a tower of black blocks. The small robot tips over a small block, possibly leading to a block-avalanche.](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/id8zdpzvvjsyyi9a9hfe.avif)
Figure: The title cuts to the middle of their adventures together, the Pebblehoarder showing its gratitude by helping Frank reach things high up.
:
:
: ![Frank and the Pebblehoarder sit together on a cliff's edge, overlooking a vast mountain range at sunset. The scene pays homage to the ending shot of the 2012 film, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/mx5gc86qpthgbzeypfw9.avif)
Figure: This still at the midpoint of the sequence is from [the final scene of _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEegn1R601M), where the party is overlooking Erebor, the Lonely Mountain. They've made it through the Misty Mountains, only to find Smaug's abode looming in the distance.
:
: ![Frank the robot stands atop the orange Pebblehoarder, popping a bottle of champagne. In the background, celebratory fireworks explode, with one spelling out "LW" in purple.](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/jdcmcy4bzxggxdallwok.avif)
Figure: Frank and the orange Pebblehoarder pop some of the champagne from Smaug's hoard. Since [Erebor isn't close to Gondor](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/Map-of-Middle-Earth-lord-of-the-rings-2329809-1600-1200.avif), we don't see Frank and the Pebblehoarder gazing at [Ephel DÃºath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordor#Geography) from Minas Tirith.
