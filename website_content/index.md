Hello! I'm Alex, and this is my pond. _The Pond_ gathers my writings on topics including AI, self-improvement, and living a good life.

The earliest content dates back to January 2018. Over the years, I've built up a web of ideas and philosophies. I even endorse some of them still! I love [my research](/research), and I hope you love it too.

I also enjoy writing more personal content and sharing a bit [about myself](/about). While my blog's [previous home](http://www.lesswrong.com/user/turntrout) made `TurnTrout` a familiar name to some folks, only a narrow part of me got to shine through. Hopefully the [launch of this site](/launch) changes that!

Stay a while! The water's great.
