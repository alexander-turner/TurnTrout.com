Edward Snowden [warned of unbridled government surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snowden_Files). He spoke of [powerful eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes) illegally spying on millions of Americans and other people around the world. Many people were upset, including me -- I [helped organize a local protest on that July 4th.](https://web.archive.org/web/20130704222703/http://www.kcrg.com/news/local/Restore-the-Fourth-Rallies-Against-NSA-Surveillance-in-Cedar-Rapids-Iowa-City-214307871.html) [Limited reforms followed via the FREEDOM Act in 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Freedom_Act).

Figure: July 2013. I'm in the center, holding the banner.

Edward Snowden warned of a day that the free world might regret its surveillance infrastructure. I think that that day [is here.](https://www.doomsdayscenario.co/p/america-tips-into-fascism-f51000e08e03254d) ICE, for example, [has cropped up as a new surveillance agency](https://americandragnet.org/), not only listening but also intruding:

> When we published _American Dragnet: Data-Driven Deportation in the 21st Century_ in 2022, we understood that the surveillance infrastructure our report describes could one day be deployed by an authoritarian executive to coerce and control the U.S. population at scale. We did not anticipate that this day would come within three years. Our hope was that the findings of our research would be useful for the communities organizing against immigration policing and digital surveillance, and would help to provoke policy change.

It would be vain to hope that the exposure of wrongdoing or the revelation of brutality could rouse the current Congress on behalf of the people.

> There is, in some sense, nothing left to be revealed or exposed. Or to be more precise, the revelation and exposure of new particulars will not tell us anything more about the nature of the political situation through which we are living. The struggle now is not to uncover the right information, but to rightly understand the meaning of the information we already have, and to face that meaning together.

 This situation has greatly worsened since that foreword in May.

I'm going to help you protect your communications and information so you can think and speak freely. The privacy won't be perfect, but it should give you  breathing room. As more people reclaim their privacy, their networks grow more secure and resistant to authoritarian punishment.

Let's get started.

> [!info]  I'm only speaking for myself
>  My day job is AI alignment research at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/). I'm only expressing my own views.

> [!warning] Not sufficient for people at high risk of _targeted_ surveillance
> Please also refer to [a more hardcore guide written by experts](https://ssd.eff.org/module-categories/security-scenarios). If you're going to enter or exit the USA on international travel soon, consider [preparing devices for travel through a US border](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/06/journalist-security-checklist-preparing-devices-travel-through-us-border).

# What should I read?

This guide is long. Don't try to complete it all at once. My website has long-lasting checkbox functionality. As you complete items, check them off to remember your place in the guide.

   - [ ] You can check off this item, refresh the page, and the box remains checked!

   | **Tier**               | **Total time** | **Total cost** | **Protection level**                    |
   | -----------------: | :--------: | :----------: | :--------------------------------- |
   | Quick start    | 45 minutes     | $110       | Online accounts secured against most hacking. Limited private communication ability.  |
   | Privacy basics | 60 minutes    | $13/month        | Significant privacy against mass surveillance. Govt. has harder time seeing who you talk to and can't monitor what you say on the Signal app. Less creepy tracking. |
   | End-to-end encrypt your data  | 2 hours  | ???    |   Mass surveillance unlikely to capture your important data or communications.   |

Each tier builds on the previous. I also wrote [a sequel focused on more advanced steps.](/advanced-privacy) Something is better than nothing. Even a few hours can transform your privacy. If money is hard to come by, don't worry - many of the best interventions are free. Do what you can.

This guide is about protecting yourself, but it's not necessarily about _hiding_. Take risks which merit the pain. Effectively resist by sharing meaningful statements while retaining your logistics and organizing.

> [!warning] What information this guide will and won't help you protect
>   If your phone is connected, cell towers track your approximate location. License plate readers track your car. Facial recognition identifies you in public spaces and others' photos. _You will be hard-pressed to turn invisible while participating in modern society._
>
>   This guide will teach you to protect a limited selection of your data:
>   1. Content of your communications (Signal E2EE),
>   2. What you're researching and reading (VPN hides websites),
>   3. Your organizing documents and plans (E2EE cloud storage),
>   4. Your network and contacts (E2EE contact storage),
>   5. Correlation across identities (pseudonymity, email aliases).
>
>   In high-risk situations, leave wireless-enabled devices at home, in airplane mode, or in [Faraday bags](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CKXK5467?psc=1&smid=AJILGO2IDT8RQ&ref_=chk_typ_imgToDp) for truly sensitive meetings. Otherwise, pessimistically assume the government knows where you are at all times. Also, financial privacy is hard and this guide only helps a bit on that front.

# Open source and encryption are your friends

This article will assume less computer science background than most of my articles do, and that's because I'm writing for friends and family. I'll give concrete, specific, and immediately actionable recommendations. For example, no decision paralysis from waffle-y lists which list the "top 10" password managers. I'll tell you what to use.

I've structured my recommendations around two key principles.

Open source code
:  If a program is open source, then that means anyone can see its code. In turn, that means if the developers put something suspicious or sneaky in the program, someone will probably read the code and notice. You don't need to _trust_ that the people who made the app didn't include creepy tracking.

:  Open source programs are usually free as well!

End-to-end encryption (E2EE)
: While iCloud might encrypt the photos you upload, that'll only prevent outside people from taking a peek. If Apple wanted to, they could look at your photos. More concerningly and more likely, if a government demands that Apple hand over your photos, they're able to and they might need to comply. However, if you enable end-to-end encryption, that's no longer possible, because only you can unlock or decrypt that information.  

: Pessimistically, you should assume that anything which isn't E2EE can be read by the government.

Unless I mention otherwise, all of my recommendations are both open source and E2EE. By following my recommendations, you will create "dark spots" where the surveillance apparatus can't look. Even in the face of an authoritarian crackdown on [thoughtcrime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughtcrime), you will have space in which to think freely and to organize discreetly.

# Quick start in 30 minutes

## Manage passwords with Bitwarden

Subtitle: Time: 20 minutes.

Use a different long password for every single login you have. Do not reuse passwords. Do not reuse passwords. Do not make simple passwords like `mail123`.

If you're not using a password manager already, _Bitwarden will make your life easier_. Bitwarden will remember your passwords and logins for you. It can even fill them in automatically. Bitwarden will generate new secure passwords for you.  Never again must you worry, "which password did I use for this website?!". You just remember one password: the master password for Bitwarden.

Here's what to do:
1. [Download Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/download/) on all of your devices. I use a browser extension on my laptop.
2. Create an account.
    - You need a master password. Use [this tool](https://bitwarden.com/passphrase-generator/) to generate a four-word passphrase consisting of four random words in a row ([justification](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitwarden/comments/14bkaur/how_many_word_for_a_passphrase/)). I recommend separating each word with a space.
    - Write down the passphrase and keep it in your wallet.
    - At first, you'll have to pull out the phrase all the time. Eventually, you'll memorize it.
3. Use Bitwarden to automatically fill in your passwords. Every time you log into an account, ensure the credentials are stored in Bitwarden.
4. Every time you make a new account, use Bitwarden to make a new login. Use a random password which is at least 20 characters long. No sweat off your back there, because you're not the one who has to remember anything! :)

Since you're using a unique password for every site, you won't have to scramble in the event of a breach. The only account which might even possibly be compromised is the specific account whose password was breached. After all, the compromised password has nothing to do with all the other passwords which Bitwarden generated!

## Two-factor authentication (2FA)

Subtitle: YubiKey > authenticator app > text- / email-based 2FA. If you're not going to use a YubiKey, at least [use Proton Authenticator](#use-proton-authenticator-as-your-2fa-app).

"2-factor authentication" means an attacker has to try a lot harder to get into your accounts.  Even if your credentials are exposed in a massive breach, your account will be safe because they won't have access to your second factor.

Enable two-factor authentication on every possible account that you care about protecting. You don't have to do it all at once. You can just enable 2FA on your most important accounts and then start enabling them in the future as you notice.

### Don't use text- and phone-based 2FA

The US government forces telecoms to permit spying on their customers (including you). _Assume that all text messages or phone calls are actively monitored by the US and Chinese governments._

> [!quote] [Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_for_Law_Enforcement_Act)
> The Act obliges telecommunications companies to make it possible for law enforcement agencies to tap any phone conversations carried out over its networks, as well as making call detail records available. The act stipulates that it must not be possible for a person to detect that his or her conversation is being monitored by the respective government agency.
>
> \[...\] Journalists and technologists have characterized the CALEA-mandated infrastructure as government backdoors. In 2024, the U.S. government realized that China had been tapping communications in the U.S. using that infrastructure for months, or perhaps longer.

Since the American government mandated vulnerabilities in key American communications infrastructure, the Chinese government was also able to exploit those vulnerabilities. We now must turn away from text-based 2FA:

> [!quote] [Government Issues New iPhone, Android 2FA Warning—Stop Using SMS Codes Now](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/12/18/feds-warn-android-and-iphone-users-stop-using-sms-for-2fa/)
> What is clear is SMS is not acceptable, even for temporary, one-time passcodes. “Do not use SMS as a second factor for authentication. SMS messages are not encrypted—a threat actor with access to a telecommunication provider’s network who intercepts these messages can read them. SMS MFA is not phishing-resistant and is therefore not strong authentication for accounts of highly targeted individuals.”

There are 2 solutions to this 2FA issue.

### Buy a YubiKey (and a backup)

Subtitle: Time: 5 minutes to order, a few minutes to set up for key accounts. Cost: \$110.

![[https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/privacy-20251008204055.avif]]{.float-right}

You buy two of these little USB-C boys for \$55 each. Use these as two-factor authentication for your most sensitive accounts, like Bitwarden. You really, really don't want hackers to compromise your Bitwarden.

1. [Buy two keys.](https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-5-series/yubikey-5c-nfc/)
2. Set up key-based 2FA on your most important logins.[^max-yubikey] For each site, register 2FA on both keys.
3. Keep the two factor key in your laptop case or on a keyring. Put the other in a secure location protected from fire and flooding. You could put it in a bank deposit box or in [a private safe at home](https://www.amazon.com/SentrySafe-Resistant-Chest-Cubic-1210/dp/B008HZUI34/ref=sr_1_9?sr=8-9).

[^max-yubikey]: [YubiKeys can hold up to 100 credentials.](https://www.corbado.com/faq/how-many-passkeys-can-yubikey-hold)

> [!question] These keys are expensive. Do I really need two?
> I know they aren't cheap. However, they will make you basically immune to being hacked on your most important accounts. That immunity brings financial security but also peace of mind.
>
> At _minimum_, you need two keys. If you just had one key, you're one "oops I lost it" away from being _locked out of your most important accounts_. Scary! By keeping a backup safe and sound, even your home burning down shouldn't destroy both of your keys.
>
> For convenience, you might even get a third key: a YubiKey 5C Nano (\$65) which you always leave plugged into one of your computer's USB-C ports. This can't be your main key because you'd be unable to access your accounts on mobile unless you always have your computer with you (and thus the Nano as well).

### Use Proton Authenticator as your 2FA app

 Unfortunately, many sites don't support YubiKey.  Whenever possible, prefer application-based authentication in its stead.

 As far as applications go, common apps store your 2FA secrets in the cloud without E2EE, which means the cloud owners could theoretically see which websites I'm authenticating with. Proton Authenticator solves both of these issues.
1. [ ] Download Proton Authenticator on your phone ([App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/proton-authenticator/id6741758667), [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=proton.android.authenticator&hl=en_US)).

## Keep your OS up to date

Make sure you've enabled automatic security updates on your device. Just search "security update" in your phone and computer settings. Enable for both.  Install operating system updates ASAP.

## iOS: Advanced Data Protection (ADP)

If you use iCloud, enable ADP. In a single flick, ADP will enable end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for the vast majority of the data you store in iCloud. The exceptions are Calendar, Contacts, and Mail. I'll cover how to encrypt those later. Also, [even for E2EE content, Apple retains limited metadata (like filename and size)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102651).

- [ ] Enable ADP in settings.

> [!warning]
> If you are in the UK, you'll have to refer to [my later section](#end-to-end-encrypt-your-data) on achieving E2EE for your data. That's because [Apple shut down ADP there after being pressured by your government.](https://proton.me/blog/protect-data-apple-adp-uk) It's as tale as old as `<time.h>`: degrading the freedom and privacy of the Web, extending government surveillance --- all in order to "protect the children."

## Secure your devices with strong passwords

Use an eight digit PIN for your phone. Using Bitwarden, secure your laptop with a _passphrase_ which consists of five randomly generated words. After a couple tries, you'll remember it.

- [ ] Use a secure password for each device.

## Always lock your device before walking away

On Mac, I just hit `ctrl+command+Q` by habit. Otherwise, someone in the area could walk by and browse. Constant vigilance!

## Use Signal over Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, texting, or phone calls

Cost: 5 minutes.

 Plain phone calls and text messages are not encrypted. That's why the government has been warrantlessly spying on them for a long time. "Encrypted" services (which aren't E2EE) aren't that safe either:

> [!quote] [The WIRED Guide to Protecting Yourself From Government Surveillance](https://www.wired.com/story/the-wired-guide-to-protecting-yourself-from-government-surveillance/)
> Digital services like Facebook Messenger, Telegram, or X may say their direct messages offer “encryption,” but in the default setting that almost everyone uses, they only encrypt information in transit to the server that runs the service. On that server, the information is then decrypted and accessible to the company that controls that server, or any government agency that demands they share that data—like the Nebraska police who demanded Facebook [hand over chats about a 17-year-old’s illegal abortion in 2022](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-turned-chat-messages-mother-daughter-now-charged-abortion-rcna42185), then brought criminal charges against her and her mother.

 The well-known application [Signal](https://signal.org/) is both open source and E2EE. Secure your communications. Use it.

 - [ ] Use Signal.

 > [!idea] Consider encouraging your friends to use Signal.
 > I don't really use other texting applications anymore.

# Privacy basics in 90 minutes

## ProtonVPN stops your internet service provider (ISP) from spying on you

Subtitle: Cost: Free, with recommended upgrade at $13.99/mo. Time: 15 minutes.

### ISPs are creepy

When you browse the internet, you send your ISP a list of sites you're browsing. They usually can't see the data you're receiving, but they still see where you're going and who you are. When you use a VPN, ISPs can no longer see that information.

> [!quote] [Internet Service Providers Collect, Sell Horrifying Amount of Sensitive Data, Government Study Concludes](https://www.vice.com/en/article/internet-service-providers-collect-sell-horrifying-amount-of-sensitive-data-government-study-concludes)
> The new FTC report studied the privacy practices of six unnamed broadband ISPs and their advertising arms, and found that the companies routinely collect an ocean of consumer location, browsing, and behavioral data. They then share this data with dodgy middlemen via elaborate business arrangements that often aren’t adequately disclosed to broadband consumers.
>  
> “Even though several of the ISPs promise not to sell consumers personal data, they allow it to be used, transferred, and monetized by others and hide disclosures about such practices in fine print of their privacy policies,” the FTC report said.

### The US government spy apparatus is creepy

US government spy agencies have [broad surveillance powers](https://www.aclu.org/warrantless-surveillance-under-section-702-of-fisa) which allow them to compel ISPs and other service providers to hand over communications data without a warrant. While HTTPS encryption (used by most major sites) prevents ISPs from seeing the specific pages you visit or what you search for on encrypted sites, they can still see:

- Which domains you visit (e.g. `google.com`)
- When and how often you visit them
- How long you spend on each site
- Your full browsing activity on the sites that still don't use HTTPS

The metadata alone reveal a detailed picture of your online life. A VPN prevents your ISP from seeing even this domain-level information, as all your traffic is encrypted before it reaches the ISP.

I recommend downloading [ProtonVPN.](https://protonvpn.com/) While Proton VPN has a generous free version and is probably the best free VPN there is, it's still the free version. I found the download speed to be slow and unreliable. When I upgraded to the paid version, my problems vanished. Personally, I recommend purchasing a subscription to Proton Unlimited (\$12.99/month, or \$9.99/month if you pay for a year at a time). That subscription will not only unlock the paid VPN tier but will also provide 500GB of E2EE storage via Proton Drive.

As discussed later in [the section on securing your data with end-to-end encryption](#end-to-end-encrypt-your-data), Proton applications are open source, E2EE, and well-respected in privacy circles.  For example, using Proton Calendar (E2EE) instead of iCloud Calendar (a government could compel Apple to decrypt your data, even though Apple secures your data quite well).

- [ ] Create a Proton account and store the credentials in your Bitwarden.
- [ ] [Download and run ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/).
- In the settings, ensure:
     - [ ] Your VPN always starts along with your device.
     - [ ] Traffic can only go through your VPN (enable the "kill switch").
- [ ] Repeat for each of your devices.

For network stability and speed, I strongly recommend upgrading to [Proton Unlimited](https://proton.me/pricing) for \$12.99/month. I recommend several Proton services, including Proton Mail and Drive. Once you upgrade, enable "VPN accelerator" in the settings.

### VPNs are _fundamentally unreliable_ on mobile iOS as of October 2025

Subtitle: And it's on Apple.

> [!danger]
> I was ready to wrap up writing when I found out some intricately bad news: [VPNs on iOS are a scam](https://www.michaelhorowitz.com/VPNs.on.iOS.are.scam.php).  iOS system services sometime ignore your VPN entirely. This ruins your protection from surveillance by exposing your browsing history directly to Internet Service Providers (AKA US spying data collection points). [Apple states that ignoring your VPN is "expected behavior."](https://protonvpn.com/blog/apple-ios-vulnerability-disclosure/) After five years of known vulnerability, no fix is available for consumers. The issue doesn't affect MacOS.
>  
> Should you still use a VPN if you're stuck with iOS? Yes, it'll still help keep you private from the web services you're using. Know that the ISP (and Apple) will be tracking you. If you don't want that, in the next post, I recommend switching [to GrapheneOS.](/advanced-privacy#switch-to-android-preferably-to-grapheneos)

The Android situation is better. Sadly, there are rare circumstances where VPNs won't protect your traffic. [Android apps can leak past the VPN when they otherwise can't connect.](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/337961996)  Android also [sporadically makes Wi-Fi "can I connect?" checks which ignore your VPN](https://mullvad.net/en/blog/android-leaks-connectivity-check-traffic), which isn't great --- but that leaks far less information. All in all, it seems like Android is better  in terms of VPNs.

### Other VPN notes

> [!tip] VPNs will rarely mess up your connection
> If your connection isn't working, try switching servers. If still nothing, and you aren't checking out anything sensitive, disable the VPN and turn it back on afterwards.

> [!info] It's not paranoia if they really are out to get you
> > [!quote] [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/warrantless-surveillance-under-section-702-of-fisa)
> > Under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the U.S. government engages in mass, warrantless surveillance of Americans’ and foreigners’ phone calls, text messages, emails, and other electronic communications. Information collected under the law without a warrant can be used to prosecute and imprison people, even for crimes that have nothing to do with national security. Given our nation’s history of abusing its surveillance authorities, and the secrecy surrounding the program, we should be concerned that Section 702 is and will be used to disproportionately target disfavored groups, whether minority communities, political activists, or even journalists.

It [can conscript](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/16/house-fisa-government-surveillance-senate) any American service provider to spy on its behalf. Sen.

## Browse the web using Brave

Subtitle: Time: 20 minutes.

I thoroughly ran available browsers against my criteria for you:

1. Strong privacy protection against commercial and governmental tracking,
2. Strong ad blocking,
3. Runs websites smoothly without major usability sacrifices,
4. E2EE history and preferences sync across mobile and desktop,
5. Open source, and
6. Good default settings (convenient for you).

I settled on [Brave](https://brave.com/), based on Chromium. The browser is a _huge_ privacy upgrade from normal browsers, especially in the context of recent restrictions on popular ad blockers. I also found it easy to migrate to Brave.

Brave's company has made [a few shady moves](https://www.xda-developers.com/brave-most-overrated-browser-dont-recommend/) in the past. But Brave is the _only_ browser which met my six criteria. In terms of privacy, Brave is [far better out of the box than its competitors.](https://privacytests.org/)  Your account information and browsing history is E2EE, meaning you don't have to trust the company itself. Even if you don't like some of the actions taken by the company, you don't have to pay anything to use the browser. You don't have to trust them that the code is secure because people [can just look at that code.](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser)

If you don't want to use Brave, I recommend hardening Firefox [using Arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js) (requires technical expertise) or using the Firefox fork [Librewolf](https://librewolf.net/) (which deletes your cookies and history each setting, disrupting your usual usage patterns).

 - [ ] On each device:
     - [ ] [Download Brave](https://brave.com/).
     - [ ] Set Brave as your default browser.
     - [ ] Enable Sync and enable syncing everything (it's E2EE).
     - [ ] Install the Bitwarden extension, pin the extension icon to be visible while browsing the web, and then [follow this guide to make Bitwarden your default password manager](https://bitwarden.com/help/getting-started-browserext/#disable-a-built-in-password-manager).

> [!note]- Optional additional protections to apply
> 1. [ ] In "Shields", enable:
>       - [ ] "Aggressive tracker & ad blocking".
>       - [ ] "Strict upgrade connections to HTTPS" (prevents snooping on your data).
>       - [ ] "Block fingerprinting" (make it harder for sites to uniquely identify you).
>       - [ ] "Block third-party cookies".
> 2. [ ] In "Privacy and security":
>     - [ ] "WebRTC IP handling policy" to "Disable non-proxied UDP" (otherwise an adversary can find your real IP address, even behind a VPN).
>     - [ ] "Auto-redirect AMP pages".
>     - [ ] "Auto-redirect tracking URLs".
>     - [ ] "Prevent sites from fingerprinting based on language".
>     - [ ] _Disable sending a "Do not track" request_ (ironically, it makes you easier to track).
>     - [ ] Disable all options under "Data collection".
> 3. [ ] Also apply these settings in your mobile Brave browser.

> [!tip] Send your friends clean links
> You ever see those _suuuuper_ long URLs and think, WTF? Generally, those URLs are full of trackers saying things like "this user came from a specific Facebook ad, has this browser version, and lives near this city." If you notice that kind of URL, go back, right-click the link, and select "copy clean link." Brave will strip away that creepy information.

Once it has it, the company uses artificial intelligence to turn a stew of location data, device IDs, and browser histories to predict a person's demographics — including race, age, gender, zip code, or personal interests. Mobilewalla sells aggregated versions of that stuff back to advertisers. On its website, Mobilewalla says that it works with companies across a variety of industries — like retail, dining, telecom, banking, consulting, health, and on-demand services (like ride-hailing).

That's why I've opened an investigation into the government contracts held by location data brokers, and I’ll keep pushing for answers."

## Use a privacy-centered search engine

Subtitle: Time: 2 minutes.

Both [Brave Search](https://search.brave.com/) and [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) are strong engines. That said, neither is as good as Google at surfacing the result you want. If you don't get what you want the first time, consider sending it over to Google by beginning your query with `!g`.

- [ ] In your browser's settings, set one of these to be the default search.

## Give each app as few permissions as possible

Subtitle: Time: 10 minutes to review existing permission settings.

Be especially wary about giving out _precise location_ data. Don't be afraid to say "no" if a permissions request seems unreasonable --- you can always read more on the app and come back later if you change your mind. Review your mobile and desktop applications in your permissions centers. Check that apps aren't taking absurd permissions they don't need (like a calculator asking for access to contacts).

- [ ] Review app permissions.

> [!example] Minimizing location permissions
> I found several apps were using my location _all of the time_, including:
> 1. My Govee smart lights app (deny!),
> 2. Maps (should only need it when I'm using the app), and
> 3. System Intelligence (doesn't need much location data).

## Your pictures and videos contain your GPS location

Subtitle: Time: 2 minutes.

Every time you take a picture or video with your phone, your phone tags the media with your location. So if you upload a picture, you're saying where you were.  If an adversary gains access to a sequence of images you've shared, they'll probably know where you go on a daily basis. (However, when you send media using Signal or Proton Mail, the application will scrub the location metadata.)

Stop your phone's camera from saving this automatically. Reduce the number of ways you unknowingly leak location information.

Android
: Search "geotag" in your settings, or just find the setting in your Camera settings.

iPhone
: Settings -> Privacy -> Location Services -> Camera and select "Never."

> [!note] Your files contain more metadata than just location
> Your photos also might expose what kind of phone you're using and the time you took the photo. To remove these from extra-sensitive images, use a special application. Example: [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.syrupy.metadatacleaner&hl=en_US), [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/exif-metadata/id1455197364).

# End-to-end encryption for your data in 4 hours

Subtitle: If it's on the cloud and not E2EE, assume the government can read it.

> [!quote] [Yale Law School](https://law.yale.edu/mfia/case-disclosed/fbis-secret-gag-orders-challenged-ninth-circuit)
> Not only does the Government have the power to issue secret subpoenas demanding your personal information from private companies—it has the power to prohibit those companies from speaking about what has taken place.

It doesn't matter how good a company's security and data handling practices are. Google and Apple have amazing security. If a company can decrypt your data, the government can force the company to decrypt your data. It's not the company's fault --- they would just have to comply.

> [!quote] [The CLOUD Act: A Dangerous Expansion of Police Snooping on Cross-Border Data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/cloud-act-dangerous-expansion-police-snooping-cross-border-data)
> The Clarifying Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act... creates an explicit provision for U.S. law enforcement (from a local police department to federal agents in ICE) to access “the contents of a wire or electronic communication and any record or other information” about a person regardless of where they live or where that information is located on the globe. In other words, U.S. police could compel a service provider—like Google, Facebook, or Snapchat—to hand over a user’s content and metadata, even if it is stored in a foreign country, without following that foreign country’s privacy laws.

On the other hand, when you use E2EE, the company can't decrypt it. Your data is just a sequence of zeros and ones on a computer. The company has nothing to hand over.

Let's secure your data.

> [!warning] iCloud's Advanced Data Protection may not last forever
> The UK [likely](https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/apple_pulls_advanced_data_protection_from_the_uk) tried to force Apple to backdoor all of their encryption so the government could spy on all iOS users, everywhere. Apple rejected this insane demand and instead made ADP (its primary E2EE feature) unavailable for new users and warned existing users to disable ADP.
>
> Apple didn't make a backdoor, and I don't think they will in the future. Even so, this incident reminds me:
> 1. How important it is to have full E2EE for _all data you care about_,
> 2. Your E2EE should not be through a single cloud provider (lest they be forced to delete all of it), and
> 3. You can't tell if closed source software is backdoored. But someone probably would notice if prominent E2EE software were backdoored.
>
> To be clear, iCloud's ADP is far better than nothing. But open source E2EE is even more secure.

_After each replacement, remember to delete your original data and to stop syncing to that source._

## Switch to Proton Mail

Subtitle: 30 minutes

Centrally hosted mail may secure your data well, but the company still could read your emails if they wanted to. Even if they treat your data with utmost professionalism, _the government can make them hand over your emails_.

Proton Mail stores your emails E2EE. Proton Mail also screens out creepy tracking scripts which "tell senders and advertisers what you read and click on, and can follow you around the web." It's easy to switch to Proton Mail. This [guide's](https://proton.me/support/easy-switch) steps are basically:
1. [ ] Create or log in to your Proton account (e.g. use the account you made above for ProtonVPN).
2. [ ] Push a button to import your calendars, contacts, and emails from e.g. your Google account.  
3. [ ] Push another button to forward new emails from your Gmail to your new ProtonMail address.  
4. [ ] Begin redirecting mail to use ([an alias to](/advanced-privacy#use-email-aliases-instead-of-handing-out-your-real-email-to-random-sites)) your new Proton email address. Mail forwarded from your old address is still visible to authorities if they go check with your mail provider.
5. [ ] Start using Proton Mail! :)

> [!warning] Most of your email can still be read by the authorities in transit
> If two Proton Mail emails communicate, they automatically use E2EE. However, if e.g. a `@gmail.com` address sends you something, the content will be plainly visible to the authorities.

> [!danger] The authorities can always track who you're emailing and when
> The problem has to do with the definition of the email protocol itself. Use Signal for truly sensitive communication.

## Store files in Proton Drive

Subtitle: Time: 1 hour. Cost: Nothing, if you've already purchased Proton Unlimited. Otherwise, about \$12/month.

I was using Google Drive and iCloud Drive. Neither are open source, and Google Drive isn't E2EE. Proton Drive has a good feature set and integrates naturally with [my suggestion to write sensitive shared documents in Proton Docs](#collaborate-privately). Migration is easy: just download your Drive content from Google Takeout and then upload to the Proton Drive app. If you're subscribed to Proton Unlimited (as I recommended for ProtonVPN), you'll have 500GB of Proton Drive cloud storage.

- [ ] Download your existing Drive files
- [ ] [Install Proton Drive](https://proton.me/drive/download).
- [ ] Migrate your existing files to Proton Drive.

## Take notes with Standard Notes instead of Notion or Roam

Subtitle: Time: 20 minutes.

Standard Notes is open source and E2EE. Great for managing your private thoughts and notes without harboring a small fear of being watched.

That said, I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), and if you do, you're fine staying put. While not open source, Obsidian's syncing service is [verifiably E2EE](https://obsidian.md/blog/verify-obsidian-sync-encryption/). Obsidian claims that the app does not collect personal data or track users by default. To be sure, you can use an open source firewall like [LuLu](https://objective-see.org/products/lulu.html) (Mac) or [Open Snitch](https://github.com/evilsocket/opensnitch) (Linux) to block Obsidian from using the internet.

- [ ] If using software like Notion, [export your files to Markdown](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/importer) using Obsidian's guides.
- [ ] [Download Standard Notes.](https://standardnotes.com/)
- [ ] [Import your files into Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.com/tools).

## Store your photos in Ente

Subtitle: Time: Depends on how many photos you have in the cloud on how many services. I'd guess this takes anywhere from 20 minutes to 3 hours. Cost: \$12/month for 1TB storage.

I love [Ente](ente.io). It has so much: fully E2EE, open source, easy migration, reasonable cloud storage pricing, full compatibility across your platforms, and the application even uses _local_ AI to search your images and recognize people!  I certainly wasn't expecting to be able to keep using AI with a privacy-focused solution.

 Plus, now all of my 23,000 photos are in one place.

![[https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/privacy-20251014141906.avif]]

<figure class="float-right"><img src="https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/privacy-20251014133220.avif" alt="" loading="lazy" width="360" height="391" style="aspect-ratio:360 / 391;"><figcaption>Whenever I read “Ente”, I think of <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Entei_(Pok%C3%A9mon)" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Entei, the <span class="ordinal-num">244</span><sup class="ordinal-suffix">th</sup> Pokemon</a> and the coolest of the three legendary beasts from the second generation.</figcaption></figure>

- [ ] Download [Ente](https://ente.io).
- [ ] Import your photos.
  - [ ] [Google Takeout.](https://takeout.google.com)[^googleDelete]
  - [ ] iCloud Photos.
  - [ ] Any private photos which don't sync automatically to your services.

[^googleDelete]: To delete your data from Google Photos _after_ importing to Ente, you'll have to select photos one screen at a time and then click "Download." I found it best to do this on desktop, zoom out my browser a bunch, and then continually expanding my selection by shift-clicking. I selected about 3,000 photos at a time.

## Make OsmAnd your map of choice

Subtitle: Time: 15 minutes.

The [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net) doesn't collect your data but is instead flooded with  data of its own. The maps have surprising amount of detail, down to the nearby benches. I  can even download a detailed map of the entire state of California for just 8GB. Don't worry, the app will give you verbal directions during your trip!

![[https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/privacy-20251022164131.avif]]

- [ ] Install OsmAnd ([Android](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.osmand.plus/), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/osmand-maps-travel-navigate/id934850257)).
- [ ] Delete your Maps location data from the cloud.

## Schedule with Proton Calendar

Subtitle: Time: 15 minutes.

Neither Google nor iCloud Calendar are E2EE - even with iCloud's Advanced Data Protection enabled. The government could compel the companies to hand over your calendars (including shared events with other people).

Proton Calendar lacks some of the convenient features of Google Calendar, but Proton calendar gets the job done and it's private. I just imported my Google Calendar and  began making new entries in the Proton calendar instead.  Proton Calendar  automatically imports calendar invitations sent to your Proton Mail address - another  reason to [do your email through Proton Mail.](https://proton.me/mail)

The main drawback is the lack of a direct "Add to Calendar" feature for external invites. To get around this, I created a dedicated Google Calendar and synced it to my Proton Calendar. Now, when I accept an invite, I add it to that Google Calendar, and it automatically appears in my Proton view.

- [ ] Download [Proton Calendar.](https://proton.me/calendar)

## Don't use Partiful or Luma to organize sensitive events

Services like Partiful do not offer E2EE.  Normal calendar events are not private or end-to-end encrypted. Even for Proton Calendar events, to see the entire guest list, the government just needs data from a single guest's calendar - especially since many guests will still be using e.g. Apple Calendar with details readable by Apple and thus by the government.

Use Signal with messages which disappear after a short time period (like a day or a week).  Make the name vague, like "Shrek watch party" or "book club".

## Secure your address book with EteSync

Subtitle: Time: 10 minutes. Cost: \$2/month after free trial.

Android and Apple contacts are _not_ encrypted, even if you enable Advanced Data Protection on iOS. I don't want the government to be able to find out who I talk to or the contact information others have entrusted to me. Here's what to do instead:

- [ ] [Register for an EteSync account](https://www.etesync.com/).
- [ ] Download EteSync to mobile devices. Don't worry about the calendar features.
- [ ] On iOS, [consult the user guide for special instructions.](https://www.etesync.com/user-guide/ios/)
- [ ] Import contacts from your existing sources.
- [ ] Create a new "Test Etesync" contact in your app and check that the contact appears in the EteSync app.
- [ ] Once you've verified these contacts work, delete your contacts on whatever cloud service you were using.

## Collaborate privately

1. [ ] To circulate secure forms, use [Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.fr/form).
2. [ ] For E2EE collaborative writing and document critique, use [Proton Docs](https://docs.proton.me/). Integrates well [with Proton Drive](#store-files-in-proton-drive).
3. [ ] Conduct video calls with [Proton Meet](https://proton.me/meet) -- well, when it comes out. In the meantime, consider using [Jitsi-powered video conferencing](https://entraide.chatons.org/en/).

# Reclaim your bubbles of freedom

"It's just one piece of information", you think. So what if the ISP knows you read an article on [`thenation.com`](https://www.thenation.com/) or [`propublica.org`](https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will)? Or that you texted your friend to ask "can I pick you up soon"?

The point isn't that individual fragments of your attention will not tell your life story. But by systematically tracking and analyzing these fragments, the government can build a detailed picture of who you are and what you think. _That's the entire reason that data brokers make money from your information_ - because that information strongly predicts what you will go, what you will search, who you know, and what you next want to buy.

Imagine: You go to a protest. [License Plate Readers log every car that drove by](/advanced-privacy#automated-license-plate-readers-can-t-do-anything-about-them). The government scans social media activity using packs of AI led by human handlers. Even though you don't post, the AIs recognize you and your brother by cross-referencing your faces (in others' photographs) against their databases derived from driver's license photos.

When you follow this guide, you obscure those digital spies and trackers. When you enable a VPN with a kill switch, or switch to the Brave web browser, or privately converse over Signal -- you reclaim bubbles of freedom in which you may think and speak.

By reclaiming bubbles of individual liberty, we thereby promote liberty and justice for all.

> [!tip] Keep reading for more action items
> To truly minimize the chance your communications get you snagged by the incipient surveillance state, you'll want to complete the steps [in the next post](/advanced-privacy). I also offer [a concrete migration plan off of Slack](/advanced-privacy#slack), which _does not_ offer privacy from  surveillance.
