Alex Cloud and I (Alex Turner) run this MATS stream.[^cloud] We help alignment researchers grow from seeds into majestic trees. We have fun, consistently make real alignment progress, and help scholars tap into their latent abilities.

[^cloud]: Alex Cloud became a co-mentor at the start of MATS 7.0.

Our mentees now fill impactful roles.

1. Lisa Thiergart (MATS 3.0) moved on to being a research lead at MIRI and is now a senior director at the SL5 task force.
2. Alex Cloud (MATS 6.0) went from mentee to co-mentor in one round and also secured a job at Anthropic.
3. Jacob Goldman-Wetzler (MATS 6.0) also accepted an offer from Anthropic!
4. Luke Marks accepted work with Redwood Research after MATS 8.0.
5. And several mentees have gone on to the Anthropic Fellows program.

We likewise have a strong track record in [research outputs](https://turntrout.com/tags/mats-program), including

1. Pioneering steering vectors for use in LLMs ([Steering GPT-2-XL by Adding an Activation Vector](/gpt2-steering-vectors), [Steering LLAMA-2 With Contrastive Activation Additions](/llama2-steering-vectors)),
2. [Masking Gradients to Localize Computation in Neural Networks](/gradient-routing),
3. [Distillation Robustifies Unlearning](/unlearn-and-distill) (NeurIPS 2025 spotlight!), and
4. [Output Supervision Can Obfuscate the Chain of Thought](/output-supervision-cot).

>  I *really* appreciate the calmness Alex \[Turner\] brings. He creates a stress-free environment where it feels easy and low-risk to have lots of ideas, pivot frequently, and generally be mentally nimble.

Our team culture is tight-knit and fun. For example, in the summer of 2025, MATS 8.0 lifted together every Wednesday and Thursday.

> On Team Shard, I learned how to form my own opinions about alignment, develop concrete hypotheses based on these, and address my hypotheses empirically. Alex Turner and Alex Cloud provided consistently thoughtful guidance and inspiration that enabled my progress. I also had a ton of fun with the team. :)
